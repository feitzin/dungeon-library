TO DO:
I want to make an easy way to develop maps. Particularly, I'd like to add an "investigate" button that prompts a body of text to describe your current room. I just need an easy way to associate spaces of the map with particular texts. I'll probably write a script that lets me design/modify these text files in-game.
